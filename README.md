# BSBL-FM #

This is a fast implementation of the Block Sparse Bayesian Learning [BSBL](https://sites.google.com/site/researchbyzhang/) algorithm. The developed algorith is based on the Fast Marginalized **(FM)** likelihood maximization algorithm, which yields ~8 times speedup while also pertains nearly the same recovery performances.

A Python version of BSBL algorithms is also available:

# A Short Introduction #

A CS algorithm aims to solve, **Y** = **Phi** **X** + **N**, where **Y** is the measurement matrix of size M times T, **Phi** is the under-determined sensing matrix of size M times N, **X** is the signal.

Compressed sensing, can recover **X** given **Y** and the under-determined matrix **Phi**. When **T=1**, we called it Single Measurement Vector (**SMV**) Model, with **T>1**, it is the Multiple Measurement Vector (**MMV**) model.

Block Sparse, assumes that **x** can be partitioned into blocks **x** = {**x_1**, ... , **x_g**}. The non-zero entries cluster within some blocks and *zeros* otherwise. If *d* out of *g* blocks are non-zero, then the block sparsity is defined as *d/g*. Exploiting both the block sparsity and the intra-block correlation is the source of the magic of all BSBL algorithms.

Our **BSBL-FM** algorithm, is an ultra fast implementation of the original BSBL framework, which brings about **~8** times speedup. What's more, It can worked in all the scenarios include:

> -    SMV sparse
> -    MMV sparse
> -    SMV block sparse
> -    MMV block sparse
> -    Real-valued
> -    Complex-valued
